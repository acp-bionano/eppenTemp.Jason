Eppendorf-sized Temperature Sensor
=========
by Andrew Payne and Charles Fracchia

We created a networked temperature sensor that is designed to have the same lower footprint as an eppendorf tube. These sensors are designed to allow the continuous collection of sample temperature in molecular biology experiments.
It is designed to interface with the [Protocol Descriptor Language]() web-system and provide quantifiable information about temperature variability in your protocols.
